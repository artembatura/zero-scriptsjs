## Description

The main idea of project is resolve the inconvenience on using popular tools, on use which creates large and complex configurations. Supporting and extending such configuration it is a chore work

## Features

- ‚è± **Zero Configuration:** Begin make things faster without worrying about configuration

- üî• **Modular:** Additional feature should be provided as separated extension package. You can always be sure that no unused packages will be can't installed

- ‚ö° **Extensible:** Extensions is a [pluggable](packages/core#process-of-loading-extensions) packages. To add a feature you need only install extension to `devDependencies`

- üõ† **Universal:** Project can't aimed only to concrete tool, framework or something else

- ‚öô **Customizable:** Use the [opportunity](packages/core#passing-options) of providing options to configurations and extensions by `package.json`
